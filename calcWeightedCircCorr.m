function [circCorrCoeff] = calcWeightedCircCorr(xy, w)
%function out = calcWeightedCircCorr(xy, w)
% Calculate the correlation between one linear variable (x) and one
% circular variable (y) as weighted by the weight matrix (w)
% Input: 
%   'xy': a two column vector where each row corresponds to the particular
%       [x, y] coordinate of one element in the linearized weight vector w
%       Note: y must be circular variable in radians (between 0 and 2*pi) 
%   'w': a column vector of linearized weights (typically the previously
%       computed Bayesian posterior probability estimates)
%
% Output:
%   'circCorrCoeff' = non-negative scalar, weighted circo-linear coefficent

% Note: the current method for estimating circo-linear correlations does
% not resolve the sign of this relationship. For this reason it is
% currently used in conjuction with the Line-Casting (Radon transform)
% approach. In the future perhaps the weighted correlation approach can be
% combined with the circo-linear method developed in the following paper
% which does resolve this sign. This would likely be more computationally
% intensive though:
